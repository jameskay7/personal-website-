                            <p>8 hours, 365, Yes I'm sweet and sour <br>
                            on this evening drive home. The clock <br>
                            is ticking, I know there's racks to be made <br>
                            We're both from 2 different worlds, I'm <br>
                            the bud of a joke and you're a jack of trades. <br>
                            (she says he's misplaced) And I live up <br>
                            in Alcatraz. Would you pay me visit if you passed? <br>
                            I go on and on spending my days watching my zeppelin crash <br>
                            I'm blowing smoke through the tints with the pigs in the back.
                            <br>
                            <p>I'm running 8 hours, 365, Yes I'm sweet and sour <br>

                            <p>I promised you palm trees, I promised you <br> 
                            nosebleed seats. I promised a calm breeze <br>
                            I promised you 6,7,8,9 fuckin G's. <br>
                            I'm thinking a vacay when the money's right and we'll both <br>
                            perk up before the flight to rome.
                            </p>
                            <p>How could you walk like that? <br>
                                How could you walk right past me? <br>
                                I could just flight, If I'm something you don't need.
